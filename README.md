# Shan's GitHub World

I am Shantanoo Desai, but you can call me __Shan__ for a much better optimized experience.

Professionally, I am a _non-conventional_ Software Engineer who works in the field of __Internet of Things__ / __Edge Computing__.
Personally, I am a practicing __Stoic__ and a __Minimalist__.

You can find all sorts of projects that I either work or have previously worked on here.

## Read About my Exploits in Technology

[My Personal Technology Blog](https://shantanoo-desai.github.io/categories/technology/) gives the reader a succinct overview
of what I am working on professionally / personally. I like keeping track of things I have worked on / working on, to keep 
things conveniently and digitally _handy_.
